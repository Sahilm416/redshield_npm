# RedShield

Implement authentication in minutes.

### Introduction

RedShield is a simple authentication SDK that provides everything you need to implement authentication in your app. It is built for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications with support for all the latest features. RedShield uses [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis instance to store user information, making it faster than any other authentication service. We not only provide authentication but also user management for a more effortless experience. 

**Note:** We are currently at alpha release, so using this in large-scale production apps is not recommended. Until a stable release, you can try RedShield and play with it. If spotted, please report any bugs or vulnerabilities at [support](mailto:redshield.vercel.app@gmail.com). This will help us to improve and provide a seamless developer experience.
